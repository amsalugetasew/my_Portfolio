    title: "AI based Pharmaceuticals Data Customer Behavior Analysis and Store Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning",
    description: "This project explores customer purchasing behavior and predicts store sales using machine learning and deep learning. It involves data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualizations to identify patterns in promotions, holidays, and store openings. Sales predictions are made using regression models and LSTMs, with feature engineering and loss function selection to optimize accuracy. The trained models are serialized and deployed via a REST API (Django) for real-time predictions, enabling data-driven decision-making for store operations.",

    title: "Amharic Named Entity Recognition (NER) for Ethiopian E-commerce Messages",
    description: "This project focuses on building a robust NER system tailored for Amharic language text of e-commerce channels. The process involves collecting data from Telegram, preprocessing and labeling entities in CoNLL format, and fine-tuning multilingual models such as XLM-Roberta and BERT-based variants. The system is further enhanced by model comparison and interpretability tools (SHAP and LIME) to ensure transparency and trust in predictions. The outcome is a high-performing NER model capable of accurately extracting key entities from Amharic e-commerce messages, providing valuable insights for businesses."

  {
    title: "Brent Oil Price Analysis and Forecasting Using Machine Learning and Econometric Models",
    description: "This project focuses on defining a structured data analysis workflow to understand Brent oil price fluctuations using time series models like ARIMA, GARCH, and LSTM. It involves exploring economic, technological, and political factors influencing oil prices and refining predictions using advanced econometric models. The study also adapts the framework to related energy markets and evaluates model performance using historical data. Finally, an interactive Flask-React dashboard is developed to visualize results, providing stakeholders with insights into price trends, influential events, and predictive analytics.",
